This package is designed to hold all of the "capabilities" that can be enabled for any
object that can calculate a list of rectangles and a corresponding collider that represents itself.

Naming this sort of object has been a real pain. Eventually, it was called
ShapeCalculator
as it must be able to calculate its shape with the list of rectangles according to various precisions.

The shape controller is what actually enables the enabling and disabling. The controller is typically
setup with a default shape calculator, but "masks"
